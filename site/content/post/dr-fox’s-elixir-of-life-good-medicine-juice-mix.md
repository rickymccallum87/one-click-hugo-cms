After several years as a veterinarian evaluating the benefits and need for various nutrient supplements for our animal companions, I followed the adage of ‘physician heal thy self,’ and developed my own fruit-juice based formula for human consumption. Most of the ingredients are readily available and very inexpensive when the benefits in preventing and alleviating a host of health problems are projected against their cost and the short time it takes to make up a week’s supply. All ingredients have been human tested for generations, are safe and effective for a host of ailments, and are best when certified Organic where appropriate, beginning with the lemons---

Slice 4 lemons.\
Put in pan with 1 quart (32 fl.oz) pure water.\
Add 1 tablespoon chopped ginger root.\
Add 3-4 teabags of Green, and/or Black tea\
Simmer covered in pan on low heat for 10 min until lemons are soft.

Allow to cool and gently mush the contents then strain off the liquid into a larger pan.

Add 1 Tablespoon each of apple cider vinegar, turmeric, black pepper, cinnamon, cumin, spirulina or chlorella, and edible clay (montmorillonite and/or pyrophyllite)*

1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (work up to 1 Tablespoon)\
½ -1 teaspoon sea salt\
1 cup aloe vera liquid\
1 cup unsweetened coconut milk\
½ cup local honey or the sweetening herb Stevia to taste

Stir well and add 1 quart of prepared, ideally unsweetened pomegranate, blueberry or other dark fruit juice like black cherry, (that you can vary from week to week). While stirring vigorously, pour into two quart-sized containers and place in fridge.

Always shake vigorously before pouring a one-half cup or more daily serving before food. You may want to start with a one-quarter cup of this potent good medicine juice. I like a cup just before breakfast.

These various ingredients will help alleviate joint pains, digestive problems, allergies, boost the immune system, as well as increase vitality and mental function for young and old alike! People with existing medical problems should first consult with their health care advisors, ideally practitioners of integrative medicine. Diabetics should use Stevia only as a sweetener, double the amount of cinnamon, use only the lemon portion of this recipe and not add the prepared dark fruit juices.
