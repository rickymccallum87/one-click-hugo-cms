4 cups Buckwheat flour\
½ cup rolled Oats\
¼ cup shredded non-sweetened Coconut\
½ cup Flax seed meal\
¼ cup of olive oil\
½ cup good quality canned dog food or fresh ground meat;\
or 2 eggs, or ½ cup peanut butter, or shredded white cheese, or sardines in oil\
1 tablespoon powdered calcium or multi-mineral supplement, or 4 Tums.\
1 tablespoon Brewer’s yeast\
1 tablespoon powdered kelp or other seaweed\
¼ teaspoon salt\

Mix all ingredients, slowly adding rice milk or pure water and knead well to make a  stiff dough. (Don’t drown the Miller!). Roll out to ¼ inch cookie-thickness on flour-dusted baking tin and incise into bite-sized, one-inch squares. Cook at 375 degrees for 25-35 min. until crisp.  Store in an air-tight container.

Most of these ingredients you can find in any health store or good supermarket, and ideally, all should be organically certified. Buckwheat, a flowering plant, produces  one of the most nutritious grains or groats, naturally lacking in gluten.

You can also add unsweetened shredded coconut, minced dog grass or wheat grass, and try some ginger for car sick dogs, and turmeric for arthritic ones. All will help dogs with digestive problems.
