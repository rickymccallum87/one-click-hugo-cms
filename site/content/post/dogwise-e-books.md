## EBOOK: THE DOG: ITS DOMESTICATION AND BEHAVIOR, by Michael Fox

"The Dog: Its Domestication and Behavior" by Dr. Michael W. Fox was one of the first and most important studies of hows dogs became domesticated and how that process impacted the behavior we see in our pets today. Written well before (1978) anyone had even thought about the canine genome, this book was a major step forward at the time in our understanding of domestication on behavior. Fox noted that the domestication of dogs influenced the kinds of behavior we see today that is in such contrast to wolves including docility, adaptability, and a reduction of "wild" behavior such as seen in wolves such as aggression and predation. It also clearly resulted in an animal who became quickly dependent on people to survive. This book makes for fascinating reading especially when coupled with the more recent work of modern researchers such as Raymond Coppinger.

## EBOOK: BEHAVIOUR OF WOLVES DOGS AND RELATED CANIDS, by Michael Fox

Prior to 1970, our knowledge of the behavior of wolves and other canids including the domestic dog was extremely limited. Little research had been done in the field and, of course, this was before the era of DNA research. In The Behaviour of Wolves, Dogs and Related Canids, Dr. Michael W. Fox, presented in 1971some of the first scientific research in the field which lay the ground work for the studies in more recent years by such luminaries as Ray Coppinger. Fox was one of the first to note the role of submissive behaviors in wolves, calling into doubt that aggressive behaviors ruled in a pack of wolves. He also recognized that wolf packs are largely family units and that the parents (the alphas) show great tolerance and acceptance of their young offspring. Even though much of the research was based on the behavior of captive wolves, much of it has passed the test of time.

## EBOOK: THE SOUL OF THE WOLF A MEDITATION ON WOLVES AND MAN, by Michael Fox

Unlike many of Michael Fox's earlier work which were fundamentally academic studies, "Soul of the Wolf" was written in a less formal style to help the reader understand the nature of the wolf and to build understanding of the wolf. It was written at a time when wolf behavior was largely misunderstood and wolves were viewed as nuisances who should be removed from contact with modern society. One of the more interesting aspects of the book is the comparison between wolf and human behavior and how both species, for example, stare to exhibit a threat, enjoy touch and physical contact with "pack" members, and the similar ways both avoid conflict. Fox's love of wolves come through in this very readable and enjoyable book.
